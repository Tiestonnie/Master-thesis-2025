# Master Thesis,  Leveraging Explainable AI to Assess Subseasonal Forecasting for the North Atlantic Oscillation

This repository contains the source code and information for the datasets that are conducted for the Master Thesis: "Leveraging Explainable AI to Assess Subseasonal Forecasting for the North Atlantic Oscillation".
This study conducts ANN models and an XGBoost model to explore the forecasting of the the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) at subseasonal scale (2-8 weeks). 
The study focuses on building a strong fundamental model to continue on and mainly focuses on the so called forecast of opportunity. 
Besided performance metrics, two XAI techniques are applied for evaluation: SHAP and Integrated Gradients. 

The results of this study indicate that ANN's are to an certain level capable of predicing the NAO, especially for forecasts of opportunity models are able to predict achieve accuracys up to 75%.
